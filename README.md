# Live Face Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates live face detection using OpenCV in Python. It captures video from the default camera (usually webcam) and detects faces in real-time using the Haar Cascade classifier provided by OpenCV.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (`opencv-python`)

## Installation

You can install the required library using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a webcam connected to your computer.
2. Run the provided Python script (`face_detection.py`) using any Python compiler, IDE, or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Press 'q' to exit the application.

## Description

The `face_detection.py` script captures video from the default camera and detects faces in real-time. Detected faces are outlined with rectangles.
